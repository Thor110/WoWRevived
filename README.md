# WoW Revived

A revival project for the classic RAGE game Jeff Wayne's 'The War Of The Worlds'

The game is usually installed to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Jeff Wayne's 'The War Of The Worlds'", but you may install it elsewhere if you prefer — for example, into a dedicated folder for modding, preservation, or portable use.

- 1 : Copy the Human disc contents to your installation folder.
- 2 : Rename the file "Human.cd" to "Human.cd.bak"
- 3 : Rename the folder "FMV" to "FMV-Human"
- 4 : Copy the Martian disc to your installation folder ( when prompted, choose *not* to replace files — or do, it doesn't matter anymore, but fewer writes are better for SSD longevity )
- 5 : Download and extract "wowpatch.zip" from : https://www.old-games.ru/forum/threads/patchi-vozvraschajuschie-cd-audio-the-patchs-to-restore-cdda-playback.51778/#post-877625
- 6 : Download the launcher from the Releases page and and place it in your install folder.
- 7 : Right-click the launcher and choose **Send to > Desktop (create shortcut)**, then launch it and enjoy the game!

The launcher will automatically request administrator permissions to ensure registry settings are correctly applied.

Language options are not available, if you have a version other than English, let us know! Thanks.

# Road Map

The road map for this project.

- ✅ 1 : Custom Launcher
- ❌ 2 : No-CD Music Fix
- ❌ 3 : Decomp/Recomp
- ❌ 4 : Remake

This might not all happen but we wanted to create a more accessible guide for running the game on modern systems, while the information exists much of it is scattered across the internet.
