How to create a language pack - rough guide.

First, create a backup of your TEXT.OJD file, just to be safe.

Export the TEXT.OJD file to a .txt file or edit them in the text editor line by line.

When translating a TEXT.OJD.TXT file, please keep the format the same, because importing properly relies on this.

That is, that it gets the entire length of the string after the third space and it relies on there being 1397 lines to the file.

0000 [FACTION] : STRING

So in this case it would return "STRING"

Everything is initially read from the TEXT.OJD file and then the strings are updated when you import a file.

Some lines are separated by "\n" new line separation, this is replaced with a real new line when importing or using the text editor.

But it is corrected when exporting or saving, so make sure to keep them as they are because the game reads them that way

After you are done translating then import the file and click save to update the TEXT.OJD file.

If you create a language pack please reach out to me as I would like to include them in this repository for future use.
