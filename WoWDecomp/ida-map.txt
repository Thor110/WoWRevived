// Quick-reference map of confirmed keycode-related GetAsyncKeyState calls in IDA
// This is NOT a complete map â€” only known, confirmed values related to current keyboard remapping functionality.
// Format: [Address] call [Function] ; [Purpose/Effect]

known values found in IDA so far

// --- Force Fire Key Handling ---
.text:00486028                 call    ds:GetAsyncKeyState ; Force Fire Cursor Key Down Event
.text:00485C83                 call    ds:GetAsyncKeyState ; Force Fire Command

// --- Intro & Cutscene Skipping ---
.text:0044E401                 call    ds:GetAsyncKeyState ; Skip Movies

// Notes:
// These values are used in the KeyboardShortcutsForm.cs class to enable dynamic remapping. ( "WoWRevived\WoWLauncher\KeyboardShortcutsForm.cs" )
// Only 2 of 33 expected keys have been confirmed to date: Force Fire and Skip Movies.
// The goal is to expand this file into a full IDA roadmap as decompilation progresses.
// IDA Free 8.4 was used to generate the offsets and context.
