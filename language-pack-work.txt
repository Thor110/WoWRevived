How to create a language pack

Export the TEXT.OJD file to a .txt file or edit them in the text editor line by line.

When translating a TEXT.OJD.TXT file, please keep the format the same, because importing properly relies on this.

That is, that it gets the entire length of the string after the fourth space and it relies on there being 1396 lines to the file.

0000 : [FACTION] : STRING

So in this case it would return "STRING"

Some lines are separated by "\n" new line separation, this is replaced with a real new line when importing or using the text editor.

But it is corrected when exporting or saving, so make sure to keep them as they are because the game reads them that way
